\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}%

This is the first intro line for this book. I'll use the intro to illustrate the various features of the template.  For example here is a footnote\footnote{\MusicNote - This endnote starts and ends with a musical note, but only on platforms that support them. \MusicNote}

\begin{itemize}
\item \large{A List Item}
\item \large{Another List Items}
\item \large{And still another one}
\end{itemize}

Now, lets look at an HREF that will give us lots of trouble. When a link is long and contains characters that make LaTeX crazy (like underscores) sometimes we need to add a print form since the hyperlink format can't be used in the print-on-demand book. Here's the reference: \HREFX{what if the spider I killed in my home has spent his entire life thinking he was my room-mate and that suddenly I had some sort of psychotic break}{https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/3adiyt/what_if_the_spider_i_killed_in_my_home_has_spent/}{https://www.reddit.com\-/r/Showerthoughts\-/comments/\-3adiyt/what\_if\\ \_the\_spider\-\_i\_killed\_in\_my\_home\_has\_spent/} --- from a random reddit post.

Here's some more text\footnote{And here's another end note}. Here I'll used some computer terms: \ComputerName{Bayesian networks}, \ComputerName{support vector machines}, an acronym: \AGI and its definition (\IdeaName{Artificial General Intelligence}), so you can see how indexing works for these things.

Here's \VR (\IdeaName{Virtual Reality} as another example.

Here I'll use some indexable terms from neuroscience (such as the \AnatomyName{corpus callosum}, \AnatomyName{arcuate fasciculus}, and the \AnatomyName{corona radiata}). To illustrate some neuroscience abbreviations lets use the neurotransmitters \NE, \DA, \ac{5HT}. Note how 5HT does not have a corresponding command name, since is not a legal LaTeX word.

So, now that we've established that this is a technical book, lets add in a citation from our book.bib.  Baye's Theorem should suffice\cite{bayes1763}. Also, since we like math, let's cite\cite{laplace1774}.

Look at the following formula:
%
\begin{equation}
K_BT_k=Dexp\left\lbrace -\frac{1}{2N(E_F)|J|}\right\rbrace
\end{equation}
%
where $Dexp$ is a long sentence guaranteed to take us over the
end of this line and well into the next. See, it looks fine.

This is the end of the chapter. And so it goes.
